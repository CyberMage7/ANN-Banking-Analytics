## Overview

This project implements machine learning solutions using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with two primary objectives:
1. **Churn Prediction (Classification)**: Predict which customers are likely to leave a bank
2. **Salary Estimation (Regression)**: Predict a customer's estimated salary based on their banking profile

Both models help businesses understand their customers better, enabling targeted retention strategies and personalized service offerings.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables, scaling, and feature engineering
- **Neural Network Models**: 
  - Classification model for churn prediction
  - Regression model for salary estimation
- **Interactive Web App**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for making predictions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Uses TensorBoard for visualization of training metrics

## Dataset

The model is trained on the "Churn_Modelling.csv" dataset containing the following customer information:
- Customer ID and demographic data
- Banking relationship details (tenure, balance, products)
- Credit score and estimated salary
- Target variable: "Exited" (1 if customer left the bank, 0 if stayed)

## Model Architectures

### Classification Model (Churn Prediction)
The neural network consists of:
- Input layer: Matches the feature dimensions
- Hidden layer 1: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
- Hidden layer 2: 32 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation for binary classification

### Regression Model (Salary Estimation)
The neural network consists of:
- Input layer: Matches the feature dimensions
- Hidden layer 1: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
- Hidden layer 2: 32 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 1 neuron (linear activation) for salary prediction

## Usage

### Churn Prediction (Classification)
You can use the classification model in two ways:

1. **Using the Streamlit App**:
   - Run `streamlit run app.py`
   - Enter customer information in the interface
   - Get prediction on whether the customer is likely to churn

2. **Using the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `experiments.ipynb` to see the model development process
   - Open `prediction.ipynb` to make custom predictions

### Salary Estimation (Regression)
You can use the regression model in two ways:

1. **Using the Streamlit App**:
   - Run `streamlit run app_regression.py`
   - Enter customer information in the user-friendly interface
   - Get instant salary predictions with visualizations
   - View additional context about the prediction

2. **Using the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `churnRegression.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code
   - Execute the cells to train the model or load the pre-trained model
   - Input custom data to get salary predictions

### Model Performance
- **Classification Model**: Evaluated using accuracy and binary cross-entropy
- **Regression Model**: Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Both models include TensorBoard integration for detailed performance monitoring and visualization.
